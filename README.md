# Repository of Road Accident Analysis in Guadalupe

Welcome to the Guadalupe Road Accident Analysis repository! This repository aims to analyze the main causes of road accidents in Guadalupe, Mexico, and propose specific measures to reduce their incidence in the roads with higher frequency of accidents and in the settlements with higher risk.

## Description

The objective of this project is to analyze the database of road accidents in Guadalupe and to determine the main causes that originate them. For this purpose, several factors are considered, such as the date and time of the accident, the type of accident, the origin of the report, the name and type of the settlement where the events occur, and the resolution of the accident.

## Problem to be solved

The problem to be solved is to identify the main causes of road accidents in Guadalupe and to propose specific measures to reduce their incidence in the roads with the highest frequency of accidents and in the settlements with the highest risk. To achieve this, detailed analysis of accident records must be carried out, considering different aspects such as schedules, contingency zones, holidays, types of accidents, roads and settlements.

## Business rules generated

Based on the analysis of the database, the following business rules have been generated:

1. analysis of schedules and contingency zones: a detailed analysis of the schedules in which road accidents occur will be performed, as well as the identification of zones with higher incidence. This will allow us to establish specific measures to prevent accidents at critical times and in high-risk areas.

2. Follow-up and resolution of incidents: A detailed process will be kept on each accident case, considering the type of accident, the origin of the report and its resolution. This will provide valuable information to identify patterns and establish corrective or preventive actions.

3. Analysis of holidays and road accidents: Accident dates will be used to identify possible problems related to holidays. This will allow the implementation of special measures during holiday periods to prevent accidents.

4. Relationship between accident type and roadway: The relationship between the type of accident and the roadway where they occur will be analyzed. This will help to identify if there are specific characteristics of the roads that contribute to certain types of accidents, and thus consider changes or improvements to the roads in certain settlements.
